    A lightweight Swift package that makes it a breeze to add a
    customizable glow effect to your SwiftUI views.

    <i>Compatible with iOS 13.0 and later</i>

## **Overview**

GlowGetter provides an easy-to-use SwiftUI modifier that overlays a view with a Metal-powered glow effect. With just one simple modifier, you can enhance your views with a subtle or pronounced glow to match your design needs. Under the hood, the package leverages a custom view (named `GlowRenderView`) that encapsulates Metal's powerful rendering functionalities.

**Please Note:**  
The current implementation of GlowGetter is experimental. We acknowledge that the rendering method isnâ€™t perfect yet, and improvements are planned for possible future releases.

## **Installation**

### Swift Package Manager

1. In Xcode, navigate to **File > Add Packages...**
2. Enter the repository URL:  
   `https://github.com/Aeastr/GlowGetter`
3. Follow the prompts to add the package to your project.

---

## **Key Components**

- **GlowRenderView**  
  This view is responsible for setting up a Metal-rendered glow overlay. It is embedded within a SwiftUI wrapper to make the effect easily composable.

- **SwiftUI Modifier (`.glow(_:)`)**  
  The single modifier that overlays your view with a glow effect. The intensity of the glow can be adjusted with a simple parameter.

---

## **Basic Usage**

The beauty of GlowGetter lies in its simplicity. Simply import the package and apply the modifier to any SwiftUI view:

```swift
import SwiftUI
import GlowGetter

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Image("example")
            .resizable()
            .scaledToFit()
            .glow(0.8)
    }
}
```

The above code overlays the image with a glow effect at 80% intensity using a blend mode of `.multiply`.

---

## **How It Works**

GlowGetter uses a Metal layer behind the scenes to produce a glow effect by blending a rendered overlay with the underlying view content. The overlay is applied using a custom SwiftUI view (`GlowRenderView`), which is wrapped up inside a neat `.glow(_:)` modifier. This allows you to add or remove the effect in a declarative manner.

> This implementation serves as a quick way to achieve a glow effect using a SwiftUI overlay. It may not be the most ideal method for high-performance or production-quality rendering. For optimal results in demanding scenarios, a more robust Metal-based rendering pipeline is recommended.
